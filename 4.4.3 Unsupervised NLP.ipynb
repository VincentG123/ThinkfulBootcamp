    "# Semantics\n",
    "\n",
    "With all the information we were able to pull out of the text, one thing we didn't really use was semantics- the *meaning* of the words and sentences.  Our supervised learning model 'knows' that Jane Austen tends to use the word 'lady' a lot in her writing, and it may know (if you included parts of speech as features) that 'lady' is a noun, but it doesn't know what a lady is.  There is nothing in our work on NLP so far that would allow a model to say whether 'queen' or 'car' is more similar to 'lady.' \n",
    "\n",
    "This severely limits the applicability of our NLP skills!  In the absence of semantic information, models can get tripped up on things like synonyms ('milady' and 'lady'). We could modify the spaCy dictionary to include 'lady' as the lemma of 'milady,' then use lemmas for all our analyses, but for this to be an effective approach we would have to go through our entire corpus and identify all synonyms for all words by hand. This approach would also discard subtle differences in the connotations of (words, concepts, ideas, or emotions associated with) 'lady' (elicits thoughts of formal manners and England) and 'milady' (elicits thoughts of medieval ages and Rennaissance Faires).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, language is complicated, and trying to explicitly model all the information encoded in language is nearly impossibly complicated.  Fortunately, unsupervised modeling techniques, and particularly unsupervised neural networks, are perfect for this kind of task.  Rather than us 'telling' the model how language works and what each sentence means, we can feed the model a corpus of text and have it 'learn' the rules by identifying recurring patterns within the corpus.  Then we can use the trained unsupervised model to understand new sentences as well.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As with supervised NLP, unsupervised models are limited by their corpus- an unsupervised model trained on a medical database is unlikely to know that 'lady' and 'milady' are similar, just as a model trained on Jane Austen wouldn't catch that 'Ehler-Danlos Syndrome' and 'joint hypermobility' describe the same medical condition.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we are going to introduce Latent Semantic Analysis.  In the next, we will discuss unsupervised neural network applications for NLP.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# Converting sentences to vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"The best Monty Python sketch is the one about the dead parrot,  I laughed so hard.\"\n",
    "2. \"I laugh when I think about Python's Ministry of Silly Walks sketch, it is funny, funny, funny, the best!\"\n",
    "3. \"Chocolate is the best ice cream dessert topping, with a great taste.\"\n",
    "4. \"The Lumberjack Song is the funniest Monty Python bit: I can't think of it without laughing.\"\n",
    "5. \"I would rather put strawberries on my ice cream for dessert, they have the best taste.\"\n",
    "6. \"The taste of caramel is a fantastic accompaniment to tasty mint ice cream.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "As a human being, it's easy to see that the sentences involve two topics, comedy and ice cream.   One way to represent the sentences is in a term-document matrix, with a column for each sentence and a row for each word.  Ignoring the stop words 'the', 'is','and', 'a', 'of,','I', and 'about,', discarding words that occur only once, and reducing words like 'laughing' to their root form ('laugh'), the term-document matrix for these sentences would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "|           | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n",
    "|-----------|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "| Monty     | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "| Python    | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "| sketch    | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "| laugh     | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "| funny     | 0 | 3 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "| best      | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| ice cream | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |\n",
    "| dessert   | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| taste     | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we use the term 'document' to refer to the individual text chunks we are working with. It can sometimes mean sentences, sometimes paragraphs, and sometimes whole text files.  In our cases, each sentence is a document.  Also note that, contrary to how we usually operate, a term-document matrix has words as rows and documents as columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The comedy sentences use the words: Python (3), laugh (3), Monty (2), sketch (2), funny (2), and best (2).\n",
    "The ice cream sentences use the words: ice cream (3), dessert (3), taste (3), and best (2).\n",
    "\n",
    "The word 'best' stands out here- it appears in more sentences than any other word (4 of 6).  It is used equally to describe Monty Python and ice cream.  If we were to use this term-document matrix as-is to teach a computer to parse sentences, 'best' would end up as a significant identifier for both topics, and every time we gave the model a new sentence to identify that included 'best,' it would bring up both topics.  Not very useful.  To avoid this, we want to weight the matrix so that words that occur in many different sentences have lower weights than words that occur in fewer sentences.  We do want to put a floor on this though-- words that only occur once are totally useless for finding associations between sentences.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another word that stands out is 'funny', which appears more often in the comedy sentences than any other word.  This suggests that 'funny' is a very important word for defining the 'comedy' topic.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# Quantifying documents: Collection and document frequencies\n",
    "\n",
    "'Document frequency' counts how many sentences a word appears in.  'Collection frequency' counts how often a word appears, total, over all sentences.  Let's calculate the df and cf for our sentence set:\n",
    "\n",
    "|           |df |cf| \n",
    "|-----------|---|---|\n",
    "| Monty     | 2 | 2 | \n",

    "| dessert   | 2 | 2 | \n",
    "| taste     | 3 | 4 | \n",
    "\n",
    "# Penalizing Indiscriminate Words: Inverse Document Frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's weight the document frequency so that words that occur less often (like 'sketch' and 'dessert') are more influential than words that occur a lot (like 'best').  We will calculate the ratio of total documents (N) divided by df, then take the log (base 2) of the ratio, to get our inverse document frequency number (idf) for each term (t):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$idf_t=log \\dfrac N{df_t}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "| dessert   | 2 | 2 | 1.585 |\n",
    "| taste     | 3 | 4 | 1 |\n",
    "\n",
    "The idf weights tell the model to consider 'best' as less important than other terms.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# Term-frequency weights\n",
    "The next piece of information to consider for our weights is how frequently a term appears within a sentence.  The word 'funny' appears three times in one sentence- it would be good if we were able to weight 'funny' so that the model knows that. We can accomplish this by creating unique weights for each sentence that combine the term frequency (how often a word appears within an individual document) with the idf, like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$tf-idf_{t,d}=(tf_{t,d})(idf_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the term 'funny' in sentence 2, where it occurs three times, will be weighted more heavily than the term 'funny' in sentence 1, where it only occurs once.  If 'best' had appeared multiple times in one sentence, it would also have a higher weight for that sentence, but the weight would be reduced by the idf term that takes into account that 'best' is a pretty common word in our collection of sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tf_idf score will be highest for a term that occurs a lot within a small number of sentences, and lowest for a word that occurs in most or all sentences.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can represent each sentence as a vector made up of the tf-idf scores for each word:\n",
    "\n",
    "|           | 1 | 2 | 3 | \n",

    "You can think of the tf-idf vectors as a 'translation' from human-readable language to computer-usable numeric form.  Some information is inevitably lost in translation, and the usefulness of any model we build from here on out depends on the decisions we made during the translation step.  Possible decision-points include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Which stop words to include or exclude\n",
    "* Should we use phrases ('Monty Python' instead of 'Monty' and 'Python') as terms\n",
    "* The threshold for infrequent words: Here, we excluded words that only occurred once.  In longer documents, it may be a good idea to set a higher threshold.\n",
    "* How many terms to keep.  We kept all the terms that fit our criteria (not a stop word, occurred more than once), but for bigger document collections or longer documents, this may create unfeasibly long vectors.  We may want to decide to only keep the 10,000 words with the highest collection frequency scores, for example.\n",

    "\n",
    "By now, you've had some practice thinking of data as existing in multi-dimensional space.  Our sentences exist in an n-dimensional space where n is equal to the number of terms in our term-document matrix.  To compute the similarity of our sentences to a new sentence, we transform the new sentence into a vector and place it in the space.  We can then calculate how different the angles are for our original vectors and the new vector, and identify the vector whose angle is closest to the new vector.  Typically this is done by calculating the cosine of the angle between the vectors.  If the two vectors are identical, the angle between them will be 0° and the cosine will be 1.  If the two vectors are orthogonal, with an angle of 90°, the cosine will be 0.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If we were running a search query, then, we would return sentences that were most similar to the query sentence, ordered from the highest similarity score (cosine) to the lowest.  Pretty handy!\n",

    "# Latent Semantic Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Cool as this is, there are limitations to the VSM.  In particular, because it treats each word as distinct from every other word, it can run aground on *synonyms* (treating words that mean the same thing as though they are different, like big and large).  Also, because it treats all occurrences of a word as the same regardless of context, it can run aground on *polysemy*, where there are different meanings attached to the same word: 'I need a break' vs 'I break things.'  In addition, VSM has difficulty with very large documents because the more words a document has, the more opportunities it has to diverge from other documents in the space, making it difficult to see similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "A solution to this problem is to reduce our tf-idf-weighted term-document matrix into a lower-dimensional space, that is, to express the information in the matrix using fewer rows by combining the information from multiple terms into one new row/dimension.  We do this using Principal Components Analysis, which you may recall from [an earlier assignment](https://courses.thinkful.com/data-201v1/assignment/2.1.6).  \n",
    "\n",
    "So Latent Semantic Analysis (also called Latent Semantic Indexing) is the process of applying PCA to a tf-idf term-document matrix.  What we get, in the end, is clusters of terms that presumably reflect a topic.  Each document will get a score for each topic, with higher scores indicating that the document is relevant to the topic.  Documents can pertain to more than one topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "LSA is handy when your corpus is too large to topically annotate by hand, or when you don't know what topics characterize your documents.  It is also useful as a way of creating features to be used in other models.\n",

Elton actually making violent love to her : availing himself of the precious opportunity , declaring sentiments which must be already well known , hoping  fearing  adoring  ready to die if she refused him ; but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect , and in short , very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible .\n",

    "LSA isn't perfect- while it is good for dealing with synonyms, it cannot handle polysemy.  For that, we will need to try out a neural network approach.\n",

    "This assignment has a lot of moving parts- text processing, tf-idf, using single value decomposition on text, and finally interpreting the results of the LSA.  Make sure to spend enough time playing with the code to feel comfortable with all of these aspects before moving on."
